# Mom's Recipies

Year's ago, I wrote an Adobe Air app for my mom that allowed her to index her recipies.  She keeps many
magazines and wanted a way to catalog recipe names and which magazine they were found in.  This information
is all stored in a local sqlite database.

Adobe Air is no longer well supported and getting this application to run on a new laptop is problematic.
Instead, this repo recreates the application using javascript and electron.

## Requirements

* Node
* Yarn


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
